    <h2>
      Epic Games, Inc. is an American video game and software developer and
      publisher based in Cary, North Carolina. The company was founded by Tim
      Sweeney as Potomac Computer Systems in 1991, originally located in his
      parents' house in Potomac, Maryland. Following his first commercial video
      game release, ZZT (1991), the company became Epic MegaGames, Inc. in early
      1992 and brought on Mark Rein, who has been its vice president since.
      Moving their headquarters to Cary in 1999, the studio's name was
      simplified to Epic Games.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Epic Games owns the game developers Chair Entertainment, Psyonix,
      Mediatonic and Harmonix, as well as cloud-based software developer
      Cloudgine, and operates studios in Seattle, England, Berlin, Yokohama and
      Seoul. While Sweeney remains the controlling shareholder, Tencent acquired
      a 48.4% outstanding stake, equating to 40% of total Epic, in the company
      in 2012, as part of an agreement aimed at moving Epic towards a games as a
      service model. Following the release of the popular Fortnite Battle Royale
      in 2017, the company gained additional investments that enabled to expand
      its Unreal Engine offerings, establish esport events around Fortnite, and
      launch the Epic Games Store. As of April 2022, the company has a US$32
      billion equity valuation.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      On August 13, 2020, Epic released a version of Fortnite that included a
      permanent discount on V-bucks across all platforms, but for those on iOS
      and Android devices, only if they purchased directly through Epic,
      bypassing Apple and Google's storefronts. Both Apple and Google
      immediately delisted the game for violating the storefronts' terms of
      service by including their own storefront, which led Epic to file lawsuits
      against both companies the same day, accusing them of antitrust behavior
      in how they operate their app stores.[6]
